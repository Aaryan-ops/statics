    <li>Do not live someone else's definition of happiness. Live your own. Emotional healing is when you face your worst fears to realize that you are okay. </li>
    <li>The inner world is more real than the outer world. Being in silence is the gateway to inner peace. We spend a whole lot more energy to make ourselves miserable than to remain on our natural state of inner peace.</li>
    <li>Inner Peace is the force that lets you know that you are safe no matter where you go. What we do with out minds really matters-what we direct our attention to, and what habits do we develop in the mind.</li>
    <li>Don't crave for anyone's understanding. It is futile. State your views, plainly, your preferences, and move one.</li>
    <li>Internal reputation is more important than the external reputation. Always make decisions that priotize your inner peace.</li>
    <li>The authority of those who teach is an obstacle to those who want to learn. The art of reading and studying consists in remebering the essentials and forgetting what is not essential. </li>
    <li>Behave indifferent towards people who proclaim their love to us, just to see if they are really different.  It is  a mistake to think that the practice of my art has become easy to me. No one has given so much care to the study of composition as I. There is scarcely a famous master in arts whose works I will not frequently and diligently study.</li>
    <li>For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them. We learn by practice. Learn to live by practicing living, to dance by prdancing, the principles are the same. In each, it is the performance of dedicated precise set of acts, physical or intellectual, from which comes shape of achievement, as sense of being, a satisfaction of spirit.Practice means to perform over and over agfain in the face of all obstacles. Practice is a means of inviting the perfection desired.</li>
